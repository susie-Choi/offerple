# Research Directions for Novel Contributions

## Current Status

ROTA has a solid foundation with:
- Multi-source data collection (CVE, GitHub, EPSS, Exploit-DB)
- Historical validation framework
- 80 CVEs collected, 3 validated with 90-day lead time

**Problem**: Similar approaches exist in literature. Need novel contribution for publication.

## Proposed Research Directions

### Direction 1: LLM-based Causal Reasoning

**Research Question**: Can LLMs explain the causal chain leading to vulnerabilities?

**Novelty**: 
- Beyond correlation: Understanding WHY vulnerabilities occur
- Explainable predictions with causal reasoning
- Counterfactual analysis: "What if we had done X?"

**Implementation**:
```python
# Prompt LLM with commit patterns
prompt = f"""
Given these signals:
- 10 commits in 2 hours (unusual spike)
- All by same author at 2 AM
- Modified authentication module
- No test coverage added

Explain the causal chain that could lead to a security vulnerability.
"""

# LLM generates causal explanation
# Validate against actual CVE outcomes
```

**Experiments**:
1. Collect causal explanations for 50+ CVEs
2. Compare with actual CVE descriptions
3. Measure explanation quality (human evaluation)
4. Test if causal reasoning improves prediction accuracy

**Expected Outcome**: 
- Explainable vulnerability prediction
- Actionable prevention recommendations

### Direction 2: Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding

**Research Question**: Can we model how vulnerability patterns evolve over time in knowledge graphs?

**Novelty**:
- Dynamic graph structure learning
- Temporal attention mechanisms
- Graph evolution patterns before CVE disclosure

**Implementation**:
```python
class TemporalGraphPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.temporal_gnn = TemporalGNN(layers=3)
        self.attention = TemporalAttention()
    
    def predict(self, graph_snapshots):
        # graph_snapshots: [G_t-90, G_t-60, G_t-30, G_t]
        embeddings = self.temporal_gnn(graph_snapshots)
        risk_score = self.attention(embeddings)
        return risk_score
```

**Experiments**:
1. Create graph snapshots at different time points
2. Train temporal GNN on historical CVE data
3. Compare with static graph baselines
4. Analyze which temporal patterns are most predictive

**Expected Outcome**:
- Better prediction using temporal graph evolution
- Interpretable temporal patterns

### Direction 3: Multi-Modal Signal Fusion

**Research Question**: Can we improve prediction by fusing code, text, graph, and time-series modalities?

**Novelty**:
- First multi-modal approach for vulnerability prediction
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Complementary information from different modalities

**Implementation**:
```python
class MultiModalPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.code_encoder = CodeBERT()
        self.text_encoder = RoBERTa()
        self.graph_encoder = GraphSAGE()
        self.time_encoder = TimeSeriesTransformer()
        self.fusion = CrossModalAttention()
    
    def predict(self, code, commits, graph, timeseries):
        code_emb = self.code_encoder(code)
        text_emb = self.text_encoder(commits)
        graph_emb = self.graph_encoder(graph)
        time_emb = self.time_encoder(timeseries)
        
        fused = self.fusion([code_emb, text_emb, graph_emb, time_emb])
        return self.classifier(fused)
```

**Experiments**:
1. Ablation study: Remove each modality and measure impact
2. Compare with single-modality baselines
3. Analyze which modality contributes most
4. Test on diverse vulnerability types

**Expected Outcome**:
- Improved accuracy through complementary signals
- Understanding of modality importance

### Direction 4: Active Learning for Efficient Discovery

**Research Question**: Can we intelligently select which projects to analyze for maximum learning?

**Novelty**:
- First active learning approach for vulnerability prediction
- Uncertainty-based project selection
- Data-efficient learning strategy

**Implementation**:
```python
class ActiveVulnLearner:
    def select_next_project(self, candidates, model):
        uncertainties = []
        for project in candidates:
            pred_dist = model.predict_distribution(project)
            uncertainty = entropy(pred_dist)
            uncertainties.append(uncertainty)
        
        return candidates[argmax(uncertainties)]
    
    def learn(self, budget=100):
        for i in range(budget):
            project = self.select_next_project(unlabeled, model)
            label = collect_and_validate(project)
            model.update(project, label)
```

**Experiments**:
1. Compare with random sampling baseline
2. Measure learning curves (accuracy vs. samples)
3. Calculate cost savings (API calls, time)
4. Test on different project types

**Expected Outcome**:
- 10x more data-efficient learning
- Practical for large-scale deployment

### Direction 5: Federated Learning for Privacy

**Research Question**: Can companies collaboratively learn without sharing proprietary code?

**Novelty**:
- First federated learning for vulnerability prediction
- Privacy-preserving collaborative learning
- Enables use of private enterprise data

**Implementation**:
```python
class FederatedVulnPredictor:
    def federated_train(self, companies, rounds=10):
        global_model = initialize_model()
        
        for round in range(rounds):
            local_updates = []
            
            for company in companies:
                local_model = global_model.copy()
                local_model.train(company.private_data)
                local_updates.append(local_model.parameters())
            
            global_model.aggregate(local_updates)
        
        return global_model
```

**Experiments**:
1. Simulate federated setting with public repos
2. Compare with centralized learning
3. Measure privacy guarantees (differential privacy)
4. Test communication efficiency

**Expected Outcome**:
- Enable enterprise adoption
- Better models with more diverse data
